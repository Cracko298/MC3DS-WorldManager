## Reasoning:
- Basically, Checkpoint is too slow, and JKSM doesn't like Minecraft New Nintendo 3DS Edition. So this is the alternative.
- Fast, simple, and Easy-to-use.

## Building:
- Build using devkitpro with libctru alongside MinGW and the standard C/C++ Libraries.
```
.\make
```

## Current Feature(s):
- Convert Worlds to Mario FWO, requires no DLC.
- Direct Compatibaility with MC3DS UniStore.

## Planned Feature(s):
- Extract/Import Worlds into ExtData for USA/EUR/JPN.
- Package Worlds as FWO (From ExtData), or from SDMC.
- Backup Worlds directly to UniStore Folder.
